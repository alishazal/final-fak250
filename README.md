Initial Brainstorming:
During our initial brainstorming, we came up with two ideas. The first idea was to work on a comic book with syle transfer. Our second idea is to come up with a bot. As this bot proposed the possibility of learning a new concept in depth, we decided to explore that further. Now our idea is to use the help platform of NYUAD, room of requirement to create an NYUAD help bot.
